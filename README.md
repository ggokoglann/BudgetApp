## What did i learn ?
During the journey of creating the Budgett app, I embarked on a rewarding learning experience. Building this app allowed me to dive deep into various aspects of iOS development. Working with table views proved to be a pivotal skill as I learned how to efficiently present and manage data. Implementing a tab bar controller enabled me to create a seamless user experience while navigating between different sections of the app. Embracing the MVVM design pattern introduced a structured approach to managing the app's logic and interactions, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code. Overall, developing Budgett has enriched my skill set and provided me with practical insights into creating user-friendly and functional iOS applications.
